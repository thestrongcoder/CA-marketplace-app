### <b><u> The Problem </u></b>

The powerlifting community is all about inclusion and helping people out. This application aims to provide the community with a place to buy and sell powerlifting goods. The original concept is to narrow it down to novice powerlifters who may not be sure what gear they need or even if they want to continue after the first competition. It has also been narrowed down to used gear, however there is no reason that new, unused gear could not be included. 

### <b><u> Why We Need This App </u></b>

Novice powerlifters aren’t guaranteed that they will have a good coach, or the right advice to get into or stay into the sport. Whether a powerlifter stays in the sport is highly dependant on their initial experience, so providing a marketplace where users can purchase products for cheaper than retail price which could get them to their first competition and into their next prep, while they find out what equipment they do/do not like, and whether they really need a piece of equipment. There is a lot of information out there, but you only find out if you know where to look.

Description of your marketplace app (website), including:
- Purpose

The purpose of the marketplace is to provide a place for all powerlifters, specifically powerlifters new to the sport, to buy and/or sell powerlifting gear at reasonable prices. This allows new powerlifters to get into the sport with the right gear without having to purchase equipment that can be costly upfront when they usually don’t know if they really want to invest into the sport. This is going to be a website which works in with the Global Powerlifting Corporation Australia. 

Not only will the marketplace showcase products, it will also provide information and links to websites and podcasts with insight to the powerlifting world. 

There will be links to powerliftingTV, the company that live streams GPC powerlifting competitions. 

There will also be links to the GPC powerlifting website and rule book. 

- Functionality / features

The main features of this application is to provide a double sided marketplace, allowing users to buy and sell powerlifting specific gear. The user will be able to view, and place an order/purchase an item using stripe payment gateway, and then review the order, showing the purchasers id, and the product id. 

Some added features, allow users to view links to the manufacturers websites so they can view more information. As well as links to media for information about the sport and competitions.

- Screenshots
- Target audience

The target audience are powerlifters of all skill levels, from novice to elite athletes. The main target will be novice powerlifters, as this will be a place for people new to the sport to obtain gear that will enable them to perform. Most powerlifters will rotate equipment in line with a competition. After a competition, wraps are usually replaced, this allows new powerlifters to use older gear without needing to fork out a lot of funds prior to knowing if they want to continue in the sport.
