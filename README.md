### <b><u> The Problem </u></b>

The powerlifting community is all about inclusion and helping people out. This application aims to provide the community with a place to buy and sell powerlifting goods. The original concept is to narrow it down to novice powerlifters who may not be sure what gear they need or even if they want to continue after the first competition. It has also been narrowed down to used gear, however there is no reason that new, unused gear could not be included. 

### <b><u> Why We Need This App </u></b>

Novice powerlifters arenâ€™t guaranteed that they will have a good coach, or the right advice to get into or stay into the sport. Whether a powerlifter stays in the sport is highly dependant on their initial experience, so providing a marketplace where users can purchase products for cheaper than retail price which could get them to their first competition and into their next prep, while they find out what equipment they do/do not like, and whether they really need a piece of equipment. There is a lot of information out there, but you only find out if you know where to look.
